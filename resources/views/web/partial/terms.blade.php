comprehensive information including information on
material specific risks about the Procedure to the Patient
and the Patient is able to Consent to such a Procedure. This

</b></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">15.1 The provisions of these Terms of Use are for the
benefit of the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates and
its third party Content providers and licensors, and
each shall have the right to assert and enforce such
provisions directly or on its own behalf.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">15.2 If you breach these Terms and the Company takes no
action against you this does not mean that the
Company has waived its rights and remedies with
regard to your breach. The Company may still take
action or exercise its rights and remedies for that
action, or any other situation, where you breach Your
obligations under these Terms.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">15.3 We may by notice in writing to you assign the rights
and obligations of this agreement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">15.4 Any notice given under these Terms by either party to
the other must be in writing by email and will be
deemed to have been given on transmission. Notices to
Consentic must be sent to info@consentic.com or to
any other email address notified by email to You by
Consentic. Notices to You will be sent to the email
address which You provided when setting up Your
access to the Service.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">15.5 All provisions in this Agreement apply equally to and
for the benefit of the Company and third party content
providers and licensors and each shall have the right to
assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its
own behalf (save that obligations under or in
connection with this Agreement may be varied or
rescinded without the consent of those parties).
Subject to the previous sentence, no term of this
Agreement is otherwise enforceable by any person
who is not a party to it. This means that other than as
set out in the first sentence above, You and Us are the
only people who can enforce the terms of this
Agreement.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">15.6 In any event, the provisions of this Agreement,
together with those provisions that either are
expressed to survive its expiry or termination or from
their nature or context it is contemplated that they are
to survive such termination, shall survive termination
of the Agreement. In the event you use the Service or
Website again, then the provisions of the terms and
conditions that then apply will govern your re-use of
the Service or Website.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">15.7 If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful,
void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that
provision shall be deemed severable from this
agreement and shall not affect the validity and
enforceability of any remaining provisions.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">15.8 These Terms of Use may be revised from time to time
by updating this posting. You are bound by any such
revisions and should therefore periodically visit this
page to review the then current Terms of Use to which
you are bound.</span><span style="font-size: 18px;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;"><br></span></p></div></div>
